✅ Created GitHub repo and connected local folder
✅ Fixed Git push issue (rejected -> resolved with pull)

✅ Created and tested placeholder files to make folders visible
✅ Wrote initial README.md

❌ sales_analysis.ipynb broke on GitHub (invalid JSON)
🔧 Recreated notebook, added data load + basic plot

🧠 Learned:
- Git ignores empty folders unless there's a file
- GitHub can reject push if local/remote are out of sync
- Matplotlib bar plot with Pandas works great for category counts

🔜 Next:
- Push working notebook
